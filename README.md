# scottgbaker.com WordPress theme 

This is a wordpress theme. Feel free to mod or download or whatever.

It uses grunt to compile sass and javascript, although you could use something else, I choose grunt because I've been using it for like 8 years. 

All you gotta do is `cd path/to/theme; $ npm install; grunt;` or `cd path/to/theme; $ npm install; grunt debug;` 

There is also a docker-compose file in here for setting up a wordpress image.
